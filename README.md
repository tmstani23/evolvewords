Genetic Algorithm:
Evolve a word phrase in your browser.

To run:
1. Click the clone or download dropdown
2. Download as zip
3. Extract onto your desktop
4. Run the index.html file
5. Refresh your browser a few times if it doesnt begin running immediately.


**Note**:
If you want to evolve your own phrase open the sketch.js file in any text editor.
Modify the line: target = 'Natural causes explain the wonders of nature';
You must keep target = and the punctuation but you can change the phrase.
Also, make sure the phrase is no longer than the original or it won't work.
